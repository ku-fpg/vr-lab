<h1>So I heard you really wanna make a WebVR program.</h1>

<h3>...No?</h3>

<h3>Of course you do. You just don't know it yet.</h3>

<h3>So what is WebVR? - In short, it's Virtual Reality Web Applications. Sounds cool, right?</h3>

<h3>I'm going to assume you said yes.</h3>

<h3>So let's get crackin'.</h3>

<h3><a href="BasicVR.html" download>It's dangerous to go alone, download this.</a></h3>

<h3>If you've never done any stuff with your website before, rename the file to "index" and drop it in your public_html folder.</h3>

<h3>If you have done stuff with your web-page, hook it up somewhere. From there, navigate to your page, it will be something to the effect of people.eecs.ku.edu/~fnameFirstLetter-FirstSevenLettersofLastName.</h3>

<h3>So congratulations, you've now in 3D, seriously!</h3>

<h3>What? There's no floor? There's nothing? Fine, I guess we can add something.</h3>

<h3>Inside that little a-scene thing, go ahead and uncomment the a-box line. </h3>

<h3>Still nothing? Okay, let's add color to it. inside the a-box, add the word color="#000000". It'll look similar to [a-box insert stuff here][end a-box]</h3>

<h3>If everything went right, there should be a black box in front of you. A-Frame makes a lot of assumptions. If you don't specify a position or size, it has default values for them.</h3>

<h3>Feel free to walk around a bit, add more boxes or any other shapes, and enjoy being in 3D.</h3>

<h3>Once you get bored, let's get started on more cool stuff.</h3>

<h3><a href="PhysicsVR.7z">Download this one to save the world.</a></h3>

<h3>So this time I started you out with a plane and a couple boxes, and even included some textures to make them look pretty.</h3>

<h3>The reason for the plane is that we're now in the magic world where physics exists, and without ground, we'd just fall forever.</h3>

<h3>For funzies, push the sandy box off the edge and watch it fall and maybe jump after it. Reload the page and repeat at your leisure.</h3>

<h3>Seriously, I spent like 30 straight minutes trying to bounce on the falling box. It's like impossible to get 2 consecutive bounces on it, even though you fall faster than it. I challenge you to try it though.</h3>

<h3>To explain a little about the physics: static-bodies will never move. Kinetic-bodies can be moved by the camera and other forces. And Kinematic bodies are things that the player can move and can apply force to kinetic-bodies, so effectively only the camera ever has this.</h3>

<h2>Assignment time!</h2>

<h3>I've given you the tools, so here is your mission. Make a basic platformer.</h3>

<h3>Start on the platform given, and place static-body objects out in open space, jump to them to then jump to a higher plane.</h3>

<h3>So for example, you start out on your plane. You jump up about 3 boxes and then jump onto another plane higher up.</h3>

<h3>Tip though: Planes are only visible from one side, you can either use this to your advantage or use a box or something else in its place.</h3>

<h3>Tip 2: You might want to consider changing your jump distance to get "better ups", as some may say.</h3>

<h3>Feel free to be as creative as you want! You can add lights, shadows, just about anything. And there are a whole lot of other objects out there, so you don't have to only use boxes and planes.</h3>

<h3>Okay, mission start!</h3>
